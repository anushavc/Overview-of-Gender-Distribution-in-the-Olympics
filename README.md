## Gender Distribution Decoded: A Comprehensive Exploration of the Olympics

Team: Anusha Verma Chandraju, Deekshita Karingula, Srushti Aparajit


Scenario/Aim: With the upcoming 2024 Olympics on the horizon, our aim is to create a set of dashboards which examine the historical gender distribution in the Olympic Games. The focus is to analyze this from diverse viewpoints, encompassing both country-specific, sports-specific and season-specific perspectives. Our analysis will span the entire history of the Olympics, from the inaugural event in 1896 to the most recent 2020 games.

Problem Statement: The challenge we aim to address is primarily because of the lack of in-depth analyses of gender distribution in the Olympic Games. While conducting research for this project, we found that other dashboards touched upon gender distribution briefly and they were not the primary focus of their respective projects. Our goal is to take an in-depth look at the gender distribution and examine it from various perspectives.

Intended audience: Our project primarily targets Olympic committee members, Country representatives involved in the Olympic Games and Sport Pundits. This would allow them to gain a better understanding of the gender distribution and help in identifying areas of improvement to foster a more inclusive environment.
